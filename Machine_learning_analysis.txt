1. Summary:
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on developing algorithms that can learn from data and perform tasks without explicit instructions. It has various applications in different fields, and its foundations lie in statistics and mathematical optimization. The term was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, and early research into machine learning can be traced back to human efforts to understand cognitive processes.
